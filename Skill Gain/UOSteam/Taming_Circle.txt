/////////////////////////////////////////////
// UO Steam Taming Macro
// for Outlands
//
// This is a "circle" taming script because it walks you in a circle around
// an aggressive tame, keeping you just out of harms way. To use it,
// start with the mob coming at you from a south-southwest direction.
//
// Each taming attempt occurs at the "top" of the circle.
//
// Why attack the creature? The tames seem to lose interest 
// following you after a while  so you need to attack them.
//
// How much room do you need? Not much - only about a 10x10 square
//
// Start in PEACE mode. The War mode toggle is to get you out of attacking your own pet.
//
// It will work for you - just need to tune it to your connection and game speed.
//
// v1.0
// ----
// * Initial version
// 
// v1.1
// ----
// * Adjusted for higher ping rates
